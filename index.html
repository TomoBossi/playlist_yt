        I began building this playlist from nothingness years ago. 2017, maybe. Since then, this has
        become to me a sort of personal zen garden. I've seen this playlist grow slowly and organically over the years.
        Whenever I carefully choose where to plant a song or an album based on sound or theme or visuals or unlikely coincidences, 
        or when I fix a broken link and bring the music back from silence, or when I make a semi-calculated rearrangement to an existing collection of sounds, I really
        do feel like a gardener full of fatherly care doing loving maintenance work for his ever sprouting greens and reds and purples. 
        To my permanent surprise, this playlist has become large enough that it sometimes feels like an entity with
        a sort of life of its own, again like a thriving garden turned ecosystem that makes half the decisions as to
        where or why seemingly by itself. I find it in many ways a reflection of my self, too; oddly one that I'm somewhat proud of.

        This website, sadly, uses Youtube's iframe API to play music. Otherwise, it was built from scratch using
        plain HTML, CSS, and again, sadly, JS. It is unusable without a proper ad-blocker.
        If we ever lose the ad-blocking battle to Google (very unlikely), I'll make sure to disable all functionality related to the API.
        At that point the site would become a mere frontend for my playlist's metadata backup, but that might
        honestly be good enough.
